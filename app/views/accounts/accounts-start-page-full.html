            <p> HMRC and Companies House are providing a service that you can use to submit audit exempt full accounts or micro-entity accounts to both HMRC and Companies House (with abbreviated options for filing to Companies House). To learn more read <a href="javascript:void(0)">how joint filing works</a>. </p>
            <p>If you joint file your accounts, Companies House will still send you an email to confirm receipt and another to confirm if they have been accepted or rejected. </p>
            <p>To check if the service is suitable for your company, read <a href="javascript:void(0)">accounts exceptions</a>.</p>
