                <p>The company runs The Village Shop, a general store in The Village with a particular emphasis on selling locally produced food. The shop opened for business in August 2005. During the financial year 2006-2007, the shop’s activities have benefited
                  the community in the following ways:</p>
                <p>- local residents (particularly those without access to cars and those with impaired mobility) have been able to buy their groceries more conveniently, either by visiting the shop or by using its telephone order home delivery service</p>
                <p>- the number of “food miles” generated by producers and consumers of food in The Village has been reduced by about 15%</p>
                <p>- the shop has provided full-time or part-time employment for 5 local residents</p>
                <p>- 8 small-scale local producers of various food and drink products, who were either dissatisfied with or unable to supply larger wholesalers or retailers have been able to sell their products through the shop</p>
                <p>- 40 households have been supplied with regular or occasional domestic services through the shop’s job-matching service.</p>
