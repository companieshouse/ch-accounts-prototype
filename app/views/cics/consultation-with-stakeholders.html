                                                <p>The company’s stakeholders are residents of and visitors to The Village, and local producers
                          of food and drink products in the surrounding area. The directors of the company have lived in
                          The Village for a number of years and developed the business model for the shop based on
                          their experience of talking to other residents.</p>
                                                <p>We ask everyone using the shop for the first time to fill in a short questionnaire about their
                          shopping habits. This has helped us to build up a profile of local consumers’ needs and what
                          we can do to meet them more effectively. Our research has enabled us to identify that there
                          are about 120 households in the village without access to cars or where residents have
                          impaired mobility, and a further 200 or so households who now use the shop for at least 40
                          per cent of their grocery shopping. We encourage those working in the shop to pick up ideas
                          for the business when talking to customers and we keep a “suggestions box” for customers to
                          provide details of products which they would like to see stocked in the shop.</p>
