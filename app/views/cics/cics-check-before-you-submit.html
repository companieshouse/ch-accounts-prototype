              <p>The company runs The Village Shop, a general store in The Village with a particular emphasis on selling locally produced food. The shop opened for business in August 2005. During the financial year 2017-2018, the shop’s activities have benefited the community in the following ways:</p>
              <p>- local residents (particularly those without access to cars and those with impaired mobility) have been able to buy their groceries more conveniently, either by visiting the shop or by using its telephone order home delivery service;</p>
              <p>- the number of “food miles” generated by producers and consumers of food in The Village has been reduced by about 15 per cent;</p>
              <p>- the shop has provided full-time or part-time employment for 5 local residents;</p>
              <p>- 8 small-scale local producers of various food and drink products, who were either dissatisfied with or unable to supply larger wholesalers or retailers have been able to sell their products through the shop; and</p>
              <p>- 40 households have been supplied with regular or occasional domestic services through the shop’s job-matching service.</p>

              <p>The company’s stakeholders are residents of and visitors to The Village, and local producers
of food and drink products in the surrounding area. The directors of the company have lived in
The Village for a number of years and developed the business model for the shop based on
their experience of talking to other residents.</p>
              <p>We ask everyone using the shop for the first time to fill in a short questionnaire about their
shopping habits. This has helped us to build up a profile of local consumers’ needs and what
we can do to meet them more effectively. Our research has enabled us to identify that there
are about 120 households in the village without access to cars or where residents have
impaired mobility, and a further 200 or so households who now use the shop for at least 40
per cent of their grocery shopping. We encourage those working in the shop to pick up ideas
for the business when talking to customers and we keep a “suggestions box” for customers to
provide details of products which they would like to see stocked in the shop.</p>
